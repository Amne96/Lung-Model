Project exists of two parts:

- System Identification
  This part contains raw data from five different patients with MATLAB scripts to preprocess this raw data.
  The MATLAB scripts and preprocessed data files are included for system identification of each patient.
- Simulation
  Main file for parameters (to be run before running simulation) and Simulink files of the different models. 

Elaborate explanation of models can be found in thesis
